Simple Javascript browser game based on the classic board game. 
There are four secret colors chosen at random, they will each be different colors from the set of blue, red, yellow, green, white and black. Select the colors you wish to guess, and submit. You will be marked with a black square for one correct guess (right color and place), a dark grey square for a correct color in the wrong place. Beginners should use simple steps to work out the colors and sequence, eg guess red, blue, yellow, green, then substitute the green for black and note the difference in marking.
